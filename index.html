      <h1>Profile</h1>
    <p class="intro">Front-end programmer with a background both in Informatics as well as Comparative Literature. <br />
      <p/>
      <p>
        I started my time at NTNU with a year of comparative literature-classes. Being kind of a book-nerd all my childhood,
        this seemed like a natural place to begin my educational journey. I didn't take long before I understood that I wanted
        to continue, and five years later I had completed my master's degree. Even though I now had a master's degree
        I didn't feel finished with studying. I decided to apply for Informatics, which was my second choice in the first round
        of applications. My interest in technology has followed me my whole life, from my love of computer games, through
        getting PS1 at the age of 10 as well as the satisfaction of solving my own computer problems. During the study
        I quickly discovered that web developing was what I loved the most. I hope to find a job where I can continue
        to develop my front-end skills, but also get to use my creative abilities.

          For our bachelor's project, each group was assigned to a real customer

          customer wanted us to make a quiz-application where two people in the
          company could play against each other in subjects related to their work.
